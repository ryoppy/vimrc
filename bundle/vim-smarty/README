A friend and I found that there were no acceptable vim syntax files for smarty, so we took the only one we could find and added everything from the smarty documentation (http://smarty.php.net/manual/en) to it.  If nothing else, this is a very good start on a complete smarty syntax file.  We have even used vimtip #498 to use autocomplete with this syntax and so far it seems to work well.
